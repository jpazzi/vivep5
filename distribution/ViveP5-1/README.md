## How to install ViveP5

### Install with the Contribution Manager

Currently this library is not available through the contribution manager

### Manual Install

Contributed Libraries may be downloaded separately and manually placed within the `libraries` folder of your Processing sketchbook. To find (and change) the Processing sketchbook location on your computer, open the Preferences window from the Processing application (PDE) and look for the "Sketchbook location" item at the top.

By default the following locations are used for your sketchbook folder: 
  * For Mac users, the sketchbook folder is located inside `~/Documents/Processing` 
  * For Windows users, the sketchbook folder is located inside `My Documents/Processing`

Download ViveP5 from [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/jamespazzi/vivep5)

Unzip and copy the contributed Library's folder into the `libraries` folder in the Processing sketchbook. You will need to create this `libraries` folder if it does not exist.

The folder structure for Library ViveP5 should be as follows:

```
Processing
  libraries
    ViveP5
      examples
      library
        ViveP5.jar
      reference
      src
```
             
Some folders like `examples` or `src` might be missing. After Library ViveP5 has been successfully installed, restart the Processing application.

### Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble, have a look at the [Processing Wiki](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library) for more information, or contact the author [James Pazzi](http://vivep5.jamespazzi.com).
